An Ordinance

To repeal the ratification of the Constitution of the United States of America, by the
State of Virginia, and to resume all the rights and powers granted under said Constitution.

The people of Virginia, in their ratification of the Constitution of the United States of
America, adopted by them in Convention, on the twenty-fifth day of June, in the year of our
Lord, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, having declared that the powers granted
under the said Constitution, were derived from the people of the United States, and might be
resumed whensoever the same should be perverted to their injury and oppression, and the
Federal Government having perverted said powers, not only to the injury of the people of
Virginia, but to the oppression of the Southern slaveholding States,

Now, therefore, we, the people of Virginia, do declare and ordain That the Ordinance
adopted by the people of this State in Convention, on the twenty-fifth day of June, in the year of
our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, whereby the Constitution of the United
States of America, was ratified; and all acts of the General Assembly of this State ratifying or
adopting amendments to said Constitution, are hereby repealed and abrogated; that the union
between the State of Virginia and the other States under the Constitution aforesaid is hereby
dissolved, and that the State of Virginia is in the full possession and exercise of all the rights of
sovereignty, which belong and appertain to a free and independent State.

And they do further declare, That said Constitution of the United State of America, is no
longer binding on any of the Citizens of this State.

This Ordinance shall take effect and be an act of this day when ratified by a majority of
the votes of the people of this State, cast at a poll to be taken thereon, on the fourth Thursday in
May next, in pursuance of a Schedule hereafter to be enacted.

Done in Convention in the City of Richmond, on the seventeenth day of April, in the year
of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and in the eighty-fifth year of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.

JNO. L. EUBANK,
Secretary of Convention.
